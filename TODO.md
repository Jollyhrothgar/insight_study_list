# TODO

## Done
- [x] Rename guide (study guide, not interview prep guide)
- [x] Add interview pipeline section (application → behavioral → technical → take-home → on-site → negotiation → offer)
- [x] Add note about practicing in "bad" environments (Google Docs, CoderPad — no autocomplete)
- [x] Call out behavioral interviews as important but out of scope for this guide
- [x] Re-examine day-to-day skills vs interview-tested skills — be explicit about which is which
- [x] Add "send me a job posting + your resume" as actionable first step

## Open
- [ ] GenAI section weight — currently Tier 2, may be overweighted for most interview loops today
- [ ] Dedicated interview prep guide (separate document?) — behavioral, round-by-round strategy, mock interview structure
- [ ] Verify all links still work
